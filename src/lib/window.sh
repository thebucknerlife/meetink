# Tail-window management — open / close / raise a separate terminal
# window running `tail -f` on the live transcript. Uses the terminal app
# the user launched from (iTerm2 or Terminal.app).
#
# Tracks "our" windows by setting a custom title marker. On every operation
# that could affect a window, we additionally compare the window's tty to
# the calling shell's tty so we can never accidentally act on the REPL
# window itself (e.g. if a stale title got stuck on it).
