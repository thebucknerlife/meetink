"""Speaker identification sidecar for meetink.

Listens on 127.0.0.1:8179. The Swift capture binary POSTs ~10s WAV windows
to /identify; /profile add (in the REPL) POSTs 3 enrollment samples per
person to /enroll. Profiles persist as .npz files at $MEETINK_PROFILES_DIR
(default: ~/.meetink/profiles/<name>.npz).

Identification is two-stage:
  1. Compare to enrolled profiles. If top match clears THRESHOLD and beats
     the runner-up by MARGIN, return that name.
  2. Otherwise the embedding is "unknown" → group it into an in-memory
     cluster (online clustering) and return `THEM-A`, `THEM-B`, ... so the
     live transcript still distinguishes voices. After the meeting the user
     runs `/profile assign A Alice`, which converts the cluster to a real
     profile and lets the launcher rewrite past transcript lines.

Cluster state is per-session: cleared by POST /session/clear (which the
launcher calls on /start), and never persisted to disk. Lettering is
monotonic — assigning cluster A doesn't free "A" for the next unknown.

Accuracy
--------
- Multi-sample profiles: each name is a centroid of all enrollment samples
  (L2-normalised before averaging). Adding more samples sharpens the centroid
  rather than dilutes it.
- Threshold: cosine similarity ≥ THRESHOLD (default 0.65) is required to claim
  a profile match. Below that we cluster.
- Margin: the top profile match must beat the runner-up by ≥ MARGIN
  (default 0.07). If two profiles score similarly, we cluster instead of
  guessing — avoids the Bob-misidentified-as-Alex failure mode.
- CLUSTER_THRESHOLD (default 0.65): cosine similarity required to join an
  existing cluster vs. starting a new one.

Endpoints

                                      (count defaults to 1; refuses if it
                                      would empty the profile — use DELETE
                                      for that)

                                      into an existing profile if `to` already
                                      exists (used to fix split identities like
                                      bob/flavio being the same person)

GET    /session/whitelist             current per-session profile whitelist
POST   /session/whitelist?profiles=alex,stacey
                                      restrict /identify to a subset of
                                      profiles (others won't match → cluster
                                      as THEM-X). Eliminates the "Mike's

                                      when going into a meeting with people

                                      else's voice) and append it to profile
                                      `name`. Powers /profile train mid-
                                      meeting so the user can click "train
                                      Mike" right after Mike speaks and
                                      actually grab Mike's voice, not their
                                      own mic input.

# --- Sensitivity presets ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Three knobs control how the server hands out names:
#   threshold         — cosine ≥ this is required to claim a profile match
#   margin            — top profile must beat runner-up by ≥ this
#   cluster_threshold — cosine ≥ this is required to join an existing cluster
#
# Different meetings want different bias. The presets below are sized
# around the failure modes we've seen, not just nudges to the defaults.
#
# focused  — 1:1s and small meetings with familiar speakers.
#            Wide MARGIN guards against bob-vs-flavio confusion when two
#            enrolled profiles sit close in voice space (the common
#            failure: Flavio scoring 0.66 against BOB and 0.62 against
#            FLAVIO, false-naming as BOB). Low CLUSTER_THRESHOLD keeps
#            an unmatched speaker as one cluster instead of splintering
#            into THEM-A/THEM-B/THEM-C across the call.
#
# default  — what shipped before sensitivity was a runtime knob. Kept as
#            a baseline for backwards compatibility, not because it's
#            the universal best.
#
# strict   — large meetings with strangers. Higher THRESHOLD avoids
#            misnaming an unknown speaker as someone enrolled. Higher
#            CLUSTER_THRESHOLD preserves distinct voices as distinct
#            clusters even when they're tonally similar.

# /session/sensitivity update takes effect on the very next /identify
# without a server restart. Env-var overrides at boot still win on the

#
# `single_profile_floor` patches a real correctness hole: when /identify
# only has ONE candidate (whitelist of size 1, or only one enrolled
# profile), the MARGIN check is meaningless because runner-up similarity
# defaults to -1.0 and `top - (-1.0)` always exceeds MARGIN. So a Mike-
# voice scoring 0.68 against Ethan would confidently get labeled ETHAN
# even though it's clearly not him by absolute confidence. The floor
# raises the bar in that case (default 0.78 — about 13pp above the
# default THRESHOLD of 0.65, well into "this is really the same speaker"
# territory). Set to <= THRESHOLD to disable the extra check.

# --- Auto-train ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When /identify scores well above noise against an enrolled profile, fold
# the embedding back into that profile's samples. Continuous self-improvement
# from real conversational audio without manual /profile train calls.
#
# Three guardrails to prevent the failure mode that bit FLAVIO earlier
# today (pollution from a wrong-but-confident match):
#
#   1. Confidence floor — match cosine must clear `floor` (much higher
#      than the matching THRESHOLD). 0.88 by default vs the matching
#      THRESHOLD of 0.62-0.70.
#   2. Margin multiplier — top match must beat runner-up by at least
#      `margin_multiplier` × the current MARGIN. So in default mode
#      (MARGIN=0.07) we require 0.14+ separation; in focused mode
#      (MARGIN=0.12) we require 0.24+. Either way, two-profiles-tied
#      situations don't auto-train.
#   3. Min samples — profiles with very few samples (cold start) skip
#      auto-train; one bad sample on a 3-sample profile shifts the
#      centroid 25%, which is too risky.
#
# Anything that does land in the profile is plain append-via-_add_sample,
# so /profile undo <name> N peels recent auto-additions cleanly. Server
# also stderr-logs every auto-add so /diarize log surfaces them.

# --- Profile representation tuning ----------------------------------------
#
# Three changes from the original "single centroid + uniform mean" model
# that the user hit pollution issues with:
#
#   1. Outlier rejection. New samples must score ≥ OUTLIER_FLOOR against
#      at least one existing centroid before being accepted. Catches the
#      common failure modes: a different speaker briefly bleeding into a
#      /profile train sample, or a /session/assign / /session/rename fold
#      where the user mistakenly identifies two distinct speakers as one.
#   2. k-means per profile. A single centroid can't represent multimodal
#      voice (calm vs excited, headset vs laptop mic, etc.) — averaging
#      them lands you in the middle of voice space, fitting neither
#      mode. With up to MAX_CENTROIDS centroids per profile, matching
#      scores against the *best* mode, not the mean of all modes.
#   3. Time decay. Old samples are weighted exponentially less in the
#      centroid computation, so the profile tracks the speaker's
#      *current* voice characteristics (new headset, recovered from cold,
#      etc.). Default TAU=180 days is conservative — recent samples
#      dominate but old ones still meaningfully contribute.

# to clustering (THEM-X) — which is exactly what you want when you go into
# a meeting with people who aren't all enrolled. Auto-train naturally
# inherits the restriction (it operates on identify's output).

# pipeline, which POSTs 10 s windows here to /identify). Result: every
# `train` call appended room tone / breathing to the target profile and
# polluted the centroid away from the actual speaker.
#
# The ring keeps the most-recent N embeddings seen by /identify so the
# `/session/adopt-last` endpoint can grab the latest one and fold it
# into the right profile. N is small (10) because the relevant window
# is "what just happened in the meeting" — a 10 s identify cadence ×

# away. So the user's mental model "A was Alice" stays valid for the rest of
# the session even if cluster A gets converted to the Alice profile mid-meeting.
